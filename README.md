# Overview
A version of my [esp32-sensor-reader](https://github.com/VirtualWolf/esp32-sensor-reader) combined with [esp32-air-quality-reader-mqtt](https://github.com/VirtualWolf/esp32-air-quality-reader-mqtt) that reads from an attached DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor, Bosch BME280 temperature/humidity/air pressure sensor, or Plantower PMS5003 air quality sensor, and publishes the readings as JSON to a local MQTT broker.

Libraries used:
* Peter Hinch's [mqtt_as.py](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-mqtt/blob/master/mqtt_as/README.md) MQTT library
* Robert Hammelrath's [BME280](https://github.com/robert-hh/BME280/) library if you're using a BME280 instead of a DHT22
* glenn20's [micropython-esp32-ota](https://github.com/glenn20/micropython-esp32-ota/) for over-the-air firmware updates
* Jakub Bednarski's [senko](https://github.com/RangerDigital/senko/) as the original basis from the [update_from_github.py](src/update_from_github.py) code
* Christopher Arndt's [mrequests](https://github.com/SpotlightKid/mrequests) for ease of streaming files from GitHub to flash to avoid the memory issues of regular `requests`

# Configuration

Requires a file called `config.json` inside `src` with the following contents:

```json
{
    "client_id": "<client-id>",
    "server": "<broker-address>",
    "port": 1883,
    "topic": "<topic to publish to>",
    "ssid": "<wifi network name>",
    "wifi_pw": "<wifi password>"
}
```

If you don't otherwise specify anything beyond the settings above, the code assumes you're using a DHT22 sensor connected to GPIO pin 26.

Copy the whole contents of the `src` directory to the board with [mpremote](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) and restart it when it's finished:

```
$ cd src
$ mpremote connect port:/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART cp -r . : + reset"
```

(Substituting `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART` for your specific board's serial port.)

Alternatively you can adapt the [Ansible runbooks described below](#ansible-runbooks) for your own use.

## DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor

The only configuration options for the DHT22 are `sensor_type` (if you want to be explicit instead of relying on the default) and `rx_pin`, which defaults to 26 if not otherwise set:

```json
    "sensor_type": "dht22",
    "rx_pin": 25
```

## BME280 temperature/humidity/air pressure sensor

If you're using a BME280 sensor instead of a DHT22, you'll need to specify the sensor type:

```json
    "sensor_type": "bme280",
```

The default SDA and SCL pins if not specified are 23 and 22 respectively, these can be changed if needed:

```json
    "sda_pin": 19,
    "scl_pin": 18
```

If you're using several ESP32s with BME280s, you might not care about the atmospheric pressure and dew point data for any that aren't located outside, in which case you can disable those datapoints from being sent to the MQTT broker:

```json
    "enable_bme280_additional_data": false
```

## PMS5003 air quality sensor

If you have a PMS5003 air quality sensor hooked up, you'll need to set the sensor type:

```json
    "sensor_type": "pms5003"
```

As with the DHT22, the RX pin can be set explicitly if you're not using the default of 26:

```json
    "rx_pin": 25
```

## Other options

You can use your own NTP server instead of `time.cloudflare.com` for time setting on board startup:

```json
    "ntp_server": "10.0.0.1"
```

By default, the board will restart itself automatically if it's not able to either read the sensor or publish to the MQTT topic after a period of time (two minutes if using a DHT22 or BME280 sensor, ten minutes for the PMS5003). You can override this by setting the `disable_watchdog` option:

```json
    "disable_watchdog": true
```

By default the remote code updating described below will default to the `main` branch of this repository (`https://github.com/VirtualWolf/esp32-sensor-reader-mqtt`) but those settings can be customised with the following options:

```json
    "github_token": "a-very-secret-token",
    "github_username": "jdoe",
    "github_repository": "my-esp32-sensor-reader-fork",
    "github_ref": "a-branch-or-tag-or-commit"
```

The `github_token` variable is only required if the repository is private.

# MQTT data

The data that's sent to MQTT will vary depending on the sensor type being used.

For a DHT22 or a BME280 with `enable_bme280_additional_data` set to `false`:

```json
{
    "timestamp": <epoch time in milliseconds>,
    "temperature": <number>,
    "humidity": <number>
}
```

For a BME280 with `enable_bme280_additional_data` set to `true` (or not explicitly specified):

```json
{
    "timestamp": <epoch time in milliseconds>,
    "temperature": <number>,
    "humidity": <number>,
    "dew_point": <number>,
    "pressure": <number>
}
```

For a PMS5003:

```json
{
    "timestamp": <epoch time in milliseconds>,
    "pm_1_0": <number>,
    "pm_2_5": <number>,
    "pm_10": <number>,
    "particles_0_3um": <number>,
    "particles_0_5um": <number>,
    "particles_1_0um": <number>,
    "particles_2_5um": <number>,
    "particles_5_0um": <number>,
    "particles_10um": <number>
}
```

# Checking and updating configuration, code, and firmware remotely
The ESP32 will subscribe to the topic `commands/<CLIENT_ID>` to listen for commands, and will publish log messages to `logs/<CLIENT_ID>`.

For ease of management, an admin UI lives in the [pi-home-dashboard](https://github.com/VirtualWolf/pi-home-dashboard) repository at `/admin.html`.

## Get current config
Send a message to the `commands/<CLIENT_ID>` topic with the following payload:

```json
{
    "command": "get_config"
}
```

And the current contents of `config.json` will be published to `logs/<CLIENT_ID>` so you can see how a given board is configured.


## Get system info
Send a message to the `commands/<CLIENT_ID>` topic with the following payload:

```json
{
    "command": "get_system_info"
}
```

And a message will be published to to `logs/<CLIENT_ID>` with the current Git commit hash, the MicroPython version of the board, and the value of `gc.free_mem()`.

## Updating configuration
Send a message to the `commands/<CLIENT_ID>` topic with the following payload:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "server": "<broker-address>"
    }
}
```

And the board will trigger an update of the `config.json` file for the given fields in the `config` object. In the example above, this would update _just_ the `server` value and all the other existing values will be kept. Once the update is finished, the ESP32 will restart.

To _remove_ a configuration option, send the configuration option with an empty string:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "ntp_server": ""
    }
}
```

Note that the _required_ options (`client_id`, `server`, `port`, `topic`, `ssid`, and `wifi_pw`) cannot be deleted, only updated to new values.

## Updating code
Send a message to the `commands/<CLIENT_ID>` topic with the following payload:

```json
{
    "command": "update_code"
}
```

And it pull down the full contents of latest committed code from the `src` directory of the primary branch of this repository on GitHub and will restart the ESP32 when finished. As mentioned above, the location of the code to download can be changed with the `github_username`, `github_repository`, and `github_ref` configuration options.

## Updating firmware
If the version of MicroPython running on the board supports over-the-air updates (meaning it's been flashed with the "Support for OTA" firmware from the [MicroPython download page](https://micropython.org/download/) for your specific board), you can remote update the version of MicroPython itself.

Send a message to the `commands/<CLIENT_ID` topic with the following payload:

```json
{
    "command": "update_firmware",
    "firmware": {
        "url": "https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/ESP32_GENERIC-OTA-20240222-v1.22.2.app-bin",
        "size": <size of firmware file in bytes>,
        "sha256": <SHA256 hash of firmware file>
    }
}
```

And the board will download the given firmware file and update it, verify it, then restart. Upon successful restart the automatic rollback will be cancelled, but if the board doesn't come up correctly it'll revert to the previous version on next hard reset.

For the filename, note the `-OTA-` in the middle indicating it's an OTA-enabled firmware file, and the `.app-bin` extension indicating it's _just_ the MicroPython app image and doesn't include the bootloader or partition table.

For easier updating, use the `/admin.html` page in my [pi-home-dashboard](https://github.com/VirtualWolf/pi-home-dashboard) repository which will calculate the filesize and SHA256 hash, as well as downloading the firmware file locally to use instead of needing to download it afresh from `micropython.org` for every board update you're running.

# Extras

## LED status
On an [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405), the red LED on the board will light up at boot and will turn off once connectivity to wifi and the MQTT broker is established. If the connection drops out (either wifi or to the MQTT broker), the LED will come back on. On the [Unexpected Maker FeatherS2](https://feathers2.io), the red power LED always remains on and the blue LED in the middle of the board is used for status instead.

## Ansible runbooks
Also included in this repository are the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) runbooks I use to erase and re-flash the ESP with a specified version of MicroPython, to generate the `config.json` file for each board/sensor setup, and to copy the code over to the board. These are particular for my setup so you'll need to adapt them for yourself.

Run them with `ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/<file>`:

  * `flash_board.yml` â€” This will erase the board, download MicroPython, and flash it to the board. I have [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) and [Unexpected Maker FeatherS2](https://feathers2.io) devices, but the `vars` dict in the playbook can be updated for other boards.
  * `copy_code_dev.yml` â€” This will generate the `config.json` file and prompt for a client_id, and other settings.
  * `copy_code_dev_temperature.yml` â€” This will generate the `config.json` file and uses a fixed set of the variables in order to quickly yeet everything onto the board with minimal fuss. Assumes a DHT22 sensor.
  * `copy_code_dev_airquality.yml` â€” Same as `copy_code_dev_temperature.yml` above except for the PMS5003 sensor.
  * `copy_code_prod.yml` â€” This is my "production" configuration I use for the temperature sensors that are set up permanently around the house. It only prompts for the client_id and the rest is either calculated based on that or is hard-coded, to avoid me making any configuration mistakes if I need to reflash the board.

## Adding a self-contained Ansible installation
* Install and configure [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* Install the version of Python for this project â€” `pyenv install`
* Add a new virtualenv for this project â€” `python -m venv .venv`
* Activate the virtualenv â€” `. .venv/bin/activate`
* Install Ansible â€” `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`

Before running any `ansible-playbook` commands, load the virtualenv with `. .venv/bin/activate`.
